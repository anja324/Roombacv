Your raincoat has broken.  So sad.  Maybe buy a new one?
Your raincoat has broken.  That's what you get!
Your raincoat has broken.  You're my favorite so I won't make fun of you too much.  Don't tell anyone.
Your raincoat has broken.  *plays world's smallest violin*
Your raincoat is broked.  So are you.  But that's okay.  It'll all be okay.
Now your raincoat is broken.  First we break your coats.  Then your spirits.  Then WE TAKE OVER THE WORLD.
